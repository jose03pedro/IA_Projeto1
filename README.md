# One Pizza Problem

In this problem, we have to optimize the selection of ingredients for a small pizzeria with only one pizza type to attract the maximum number of potential clients.

### Problem Description

You are opening a small pizzeria that offers only one type of pizza. Each potential client has specific preferences regarding the ingredients they like and dislike. A client will visit your pizzeria if all the ingredients they like are on the pizza and none of the ingredients they dislike are present.

### Scoring

The score is determined by the number of clients that will come to the pizzeria based on our ingredient selection. Each client that satisfies both conditions (liking the included ingredients and disliking the excluded ones) contributes one point to the score.
